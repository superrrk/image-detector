# ðŸ§  Fake Image Detector

> A deep learning-powered web app that detects whether an image of a human face is AI-generated (fake) or real.

This project combines a custom PyTorch convolutional neural network (CNN) with a full-stack Flask + React frontend. Users can upload or select images, receive real-time predictions with confidence scores, and visualize saliency maps that explain the model's decision.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, SCSS
- **Backend:** Flask, PyTorch, Captum (for saliency maps)
- **Model:** Custom CNN trained to classify real vs AI-generated faces (87% accuracy)
- **Other:** Numpy, Matplotlib, Pillow

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Upload or drag-and-drop image input  
- Real-time classification of image as **REAL** or **FAKE**  
- Saliency map generation to visualize which image regions influenced the model  
- Confidence scores for each prediction  
- Sample image gallery (Ed Sheeran, Michelle Obama, etc.)  
- Light/dark mode toggle  
- Mobile responsive UI

## ðŸ§  Model

A lightweight CNN was trained on real and GAN-generated face images using PyTorch. The model achieved **87% accuracy** on the validation set. Saliency maps were generated with **Captum** to explain the model's attention.

Training steps included:

- Dataset preprocessing and 80/20 train-validation split  
- Image normalization, resizing  
- 20-epoch training loop using CrossEntropyLoss + Adam optimizer  
- TorchVision for data loading and transforms
